# Hit Indication

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mod adds indicators to show where you got damaged from, much like in games such as Call of Duty, and Halo. The config options allow you to change stuff such as the opacity of the indicators, their fade out rate, and even whether a blue block indicator should appear if you block an attack with a shield.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be used in any modpack without asking for premission as long as you give substantial credit, aka, a little more credit just having the mod in the Relations tab.
